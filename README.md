# Classifying-foot-gestures-using-accelerometer-and-gyroscope

The goal of the project was to classify 2 foot gestures using accelerometer and gyroscope data. Each gesture data was collected for 30 seconds. A gesture lasts about 1 second. So for 30 seconds a person continously perfomed a gesture whilst we collected the data.

## Data
The dataset is private so it cannot be shared publically. However, there were 4 gestures in total.
1) FootTap
2) FowardStep
3) SideTap
4) Stomp
